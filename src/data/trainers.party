/*
Trainers and their parties defined with Competetive Syntax.
Compatible with Pokemon Showdown exports.
https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/TEAMS.md

A trainer specification starts with "=== TRAINER_XXXX ==="
and includes everything until the next line that starts with "==="
or the file ends.
A blank line is required between the trainer and their Pokemon
and between their Pokemon.
TRAINER_XXXX is how the trainer is referred to within code.

Fields with description and/or example of usage
Required fields for trainers:
    - Name
    - Pic
Optional (but still recommended) fields for trainers:
    - Class (if not specified, PkMn Trainer will be used)
    - Gender (Male/Female, affects random gender weights of party if not specified)
    - Music

    - Mugshot (enable Mugshots during battle transition
               set to one of Purple, Green, Pink, Blue or Yellow)

      Both lines are valid. Gender (M) or (F) must use a capital letter.
      Nickname length is limited to 10 characters using standard letters.
      With narrow font it's increased to 12. Longer strings will be silently shortened.

Optional fields for Pokemon:

    - Tera Type (Set to a Type, either Fire or TYPE_FIRE, also sets "shouldTerastal" to True)
Moves are defined with a - (dash) followed by a single space, then the move name.
Either "- Tackle" or "- MOVE_TACKLE" works. One move per line.
Moves have to be the last lines of a Pokemon.
If no moves are specified, the Pokemon will use the last 4 moves it learns
through levelup at its level.

Default IVs and Level can be changed in the "main" function of tools/trainerproc/main.c
