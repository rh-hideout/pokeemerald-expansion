# Pokémon Black and White 2 - GBA Demake
Welcome to pokeblack2! pokeblack2 is a GBA Demake of Pokémon Black 2 and Pokémon White 2, intended to be as faithful to the original games as possible. pokeblack2 is built upon the incredible work of the [rh-hideout](https://github.com/rh-hideout) team, and their work on the [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion). While pokeblack2 is intended to be as faithful as possible to the original Pokémon Black 2/White 2 games, there are still some features and mechanics that will be absent, as we are a small team with limited time and resources.

## What Features Are/Will Be Present?
The following features are planned to be added in a future release, or have already been added in a past release. For more details and a more extensive list, check the project's [milestones](https://github.com/Pokemon-Demake-Team/pokeblack2/milestones).
 - **A complete UI overhaul.** The UI will be overhauled to match Pokémon Black and White 2 as closely possible. However, there are a few limitations. Since Pokémon Black and White 2 are DS titles, some things will need to be tweaked to make it fit the single-screen GBA layout. We are recreating this layout based on cross-comparison and looks alone, not porting it, so it won't match the Black 2/White 2 UI exactly.
 - **Gen 5 Battle Mechanics powered by the pokeemerald-expansion.** The pokeemerald-expansion has features from all modern generations implemented, so all of the battle mechanics will be tweaked to match Gen 5 as closely as possible (e.g. infinite weather, all of the different types of gems, etc.)
 - **A complete recreation of the Unovan overworld.** This hack aims to recreate Pokémon Black and White 2 using Pokémon Emerald's engine. As such, our goal is to reimagine the overworld, recreating the tilesets, assets, maps, NPCs, battles, music, and more to more closely match their Unova counterparts. This is by far the largest and most daunting task, so it will likely take the longest to get to a place in which we are comfortable calling it faithful.
 - **The B2W2 Pokédex.** Thanks to the pokeemerald-expansion, we are able to include Pokémon up to Gen 5, and update the Pokédex to reflect this. We have tried our best to recreate the encounter tables to match the original games, so there may be Pokémon that are unobtainable or not present, as in the original games.
 - **Generation 5 exclusive features.** The Gen 5 games introduced many features and mechanics that were never seen before or again, like seasons, the PWT, the key system, etc. We have tried our best to recreate those features, although they may not be fully accurate or perfect.
 - **Fully open-source and always free.** This is a project made by and for the rom hacking community. As per our and the Rom Hacking Hideout's policies, no project using our work as a base or any of its assets may require or request money in any way, including donations, unless specifically given permission by the Rom Hacking Hideout and the Pokémon Demake Team. If you find an issue or have a feature you want us to tweak, you may [report it](https://github.com/Pokemon-Demake-Team/pokeblack2/issues) and we will attempt to fix it as soon as time allows. Please remember we are a small team doing this in our free time, so it may take a little bit for us to get to your issue or request.

## What Is pokeblack2 NOT?
 - **Completely faithful.** It is impossible to completely and perfectly recreate all of the features, especially with no decompilation available for the Gen 5 games. As such, certain features may not be implemented perfectly or at all. Again, we are a small team with limited resources available, so certain features or mechanics may be out of our limited scope and may not be implemented completely faithfully.
 - **A demake of Pokémon Black and White** This project solely focuses on demaking Pokémon Black and White 2. There are currently no plans to demake original (Pokémon Black and White) games, but that is subject to change once pokeblack2 reaches a stable state.

## What Is the Status of the Project?
Currently, pokeblack2 is `0%` completed. This will be updated periodically as the project is worked on. **An exact release/completion date will NEVER be provided,** as we are not a game studio and have limited available time and resources.
