# About `emerald-battle-factory`

**`emerald-battle-factory`** is a modified version of Pokémon Emerald, built on top of RHH's `pokeemerald-expansion`
[decompilation project](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion). 

# Features

**`emerald-battle-factory`** benefits from all of the features of the expansion project, such as the Physical-Special split,
Fairy type, and many more. See the repo's `FEATURES.MD` for more details.

The focus of this ROM hack is to modernise the Battle Factory facility. Although `pokeemerald-expansion` supports all these
modern features, the Battle Frontier has not been updated to take advantage of them. So trainers still use the same sets
which were not built with the expansion in mind. 

- Smogon sample sets from Gen 9 ZU to OU appear in the Battle Factory (currently only single battles - double battles are unchanged for the time being). These sets were scraped 
from a [pkmn.github.io API](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion)
- Optional battle speedup (adapted from [Pokémon Emerald Rogue](https://github.com/Pokabbie/pokeemerald-rogue))
- Instant text option
- Start game immediately outside Battle Factory
