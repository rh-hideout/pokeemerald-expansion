incorrect shiny, shiny is suppose to be blue, 
icon sprite was just a placeholder and i think its offset and just a still sprite. 
i couldn't figure out how to fix the colour issue with. Same with the back sprite- 
i tried to modify DrDollSteak's backsprite to make it shiny since all the other back sprites on the megas are shiny-
same issue with the icon sprite, i personally couldn't get it to work.

Normal.pal is the green mega dragonite
