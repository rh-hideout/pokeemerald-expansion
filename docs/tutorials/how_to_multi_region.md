# How to add multiple regions
*Written by OpticalMagician*

## Steps to implement multiple regions
In order to enable multiple regions we need a couple of things for each region first:

* The corect region map file. See [How to create a Region Map]((https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/docs/how_to_region_map.md)) if you do not already have these.

Then we have a couple steps to take to implement our region:

* Add our region map files to the correct locations
* Add our region to the list of available regions
* Handle our region in the town map graphics
* Handle our region in the pokedex
* Handle our region in the daycare
